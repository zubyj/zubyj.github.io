            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>LeetTube does not collect any personal or sensitive user data. Our extension uses local storage to store
                LeetCode problem data, which is used only for providing the functionality of injecting YouTube video
                solutions into LeetCode problem pages.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>All data used by LeetTube is stored locally on the user's device and is not transmitted or shared with
                any third-party services or entities. We do not collect or handle any personal or sensitive user data,
                and thus there is no data transmission or storage that requires encryption.</p>
